smart_zones is a study to create ambient non player characters, interacting with each other on pre-defined
locations depending on their role. 

Basically whenever a NPC walks into a smart zone, the zone would perform checks if the NPC has a role it needs for it's scene.
If it passes this check, the NPC would then have to perform the role assigned to him until the scene ends. Otherwise the NPC just ignores
the zone and goes on with his business.

This is an old project that admittedly deserves a rewrite to be more extendable,designer friendly as well as add other features like role weights, dynamic roles and procedural smart zone generation which I am very interested in. Hoping I have time again to get back to this project to make a more believable living scene.

This project was inspired by an article I've read here http://www.gameaipro.com/
